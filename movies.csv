2001 A Space Odyssey,"The film is divided into several parts. It begins in prehistoric Africa, where a mysterious black monolith appears and inspires a tribe of hominids to develop tools, leading to their dominance. Millions of years later, in 2001, a second monolith is discovered on the Moon, buried near the crater Tycho. When exposed to sunlight, it emits a powerful radio signal towards Jupiter. Eighteen months later, the spaceship Discovery One is on a mission to Jupiter to investigate this signal, with mission pilots Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole, and three scientists in suspended animation. The ship is largely controlled by HAL 9000, an artificially intelligent computer with a human-like personality. HAL begins to malfunction, reporting a false equipment failure and then attacking Poole during an EVA and killing the hibernating crew. Bowman, realizing HAL's treachery, manages to re-enter the ship and disconnect most of HAL's circuits. He then discovers the true purpose of the mission: to investigate the Jupiter signal. At Jupiter, Bowman finds a third, larger monolith. He leaves Discovery in an EVA pod and is pulled into a vortex of colored light, experiencing bizarre astronomical phenomena and landscapes. He finds himself in a neoclassical bedroom where he ages rapidly, eventually transforming into a ""Star-Child"" – a fetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light – which floats in space above Earth."
The Rules of the Game,"This refers to a play by Luigi Pirandello. The plot centers on Leone, a man estranged from his wife Silia, who is having an affair with Guido. Rather than reacting with anger or betrayal, Leone chooses to detach himself emotionally, becoming, as he states, ""like an empty eggshell."" He then manipulates Guido into taking his place in a duel, which results in Guido's death. Other characters include a group of drunken young men who provide the opportunity for Silia's scheming, two friends of Leone (Barelli and Dr. Spiga), and Leone's servant, Philip."
The Searchers,"In 1868, Confederate veteran Ethan Edwards returns to his brother's home in West Texas after an eight-year absence. Soon after, their homestead is attacked by Comanches, and Ethan's brother, his wife, and son are killed, while his two nieces, Debbie and Lucy, are abducted. Ethan, along with Lucy's fiancé Brad Jorgensen and his adopted nephew Martin Pawley, embark on a relentless five-year search for the girls. Brad is killed early in the search. Ethan's hatred for the Comanches grows, especially when they find Lucy dead. Years later, they locate Debbie, now an adolescent, living as one of Chief Scar's wives. Ethan, believing she has become ""Indian,"" attempts to kill her, but Martin protects her. They eventually return home. Later, a full attack is launched on Scar's camp. Martin kills Scar, and Ethan scalps him. Ethan finds Debbie and pursues her, but instead of killing her, he carries her home. The film ends with Ethan, the perpetual loner, watching his family re-enter the house, but remaining outside, framed by the doorway."
Seven Samurai,"In 1586, a bandit gang plans to raid a mountain village after the harvest. The villagers, desperate, decide to hire samurai for protection, despite having no money and only offering food as payment. Gisaku, the village elder, advises them to find hungry samurai. They find Kambei, an aging but experienced rōnin, who reluctantly agrees to help. Kambei recruits five more samurai: his old comrade Shichirōji, the jovial Gorobei, the kind Heihachi, the stoic master swordsman Kyūzō, and the wild, eccentric samurai-poser Kikuchiyo (who is later accepted). The samurai train the villagers to fight with bamboo spears and fortify their village. They launch a pre-emptive strike on a bandit camp, but Heihachi is killed. During the final battle, many bandits are killed as they try to breach the village's defenses. Kyūzō and Gorobei are also killed. In the end, the surviving samurai (Kambei, Katsushirō, and Shichirōji) stand over the graves of their fallen comrades, watching the joyful villagers plant their crops. Kambei observes that the victory belongs to the peasants, not to them."
"Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles","The film provides a slice-of-life depiction of Jeanne Dielman, a widowed housewife, over three days. Her life is meticulously regimented: she cooks, cleans, cares for her son, and runs errands. To earn money, she engages in prostitution with a different client each afternoon before her son returns home. This act, like all her other activities, is performed as part of her mundane routine. However, after a client visit on the second day, her orderly behavior subtly begins to unravel. She overcooks potatoes, forgets to turn off lights, and drops objects. These minor disruptions to her routine continue. On the third day, after having sex with a client, she dresses, walks back to the bed, and stabs him to death with a pair of scissors. She then sits quietly at her dining room table."
Apocalypse Now,"In 1969, during the Vietnam War, U.S. Army Captain Benjamin L. Willard, a jaded MACV-SOG operative, is sent on a secret mission: to ""terminate with extreme prejudice"" the command of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. Kurtz, a highly decorated Special Forces officer, has gone rogue and is waging a brutal war in eastern Cambodia, commanding his own forces and being worshipped as a demigod by indigenous tribes. Willard travels up the Nùng River on a U.S. Navy patrol boat (PBR) with a crew. Along the journey, they encounter the surreal and horrific realities of the war, including a helicopter assault led by Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore and the psychological breakdown of the crew. As they get closer to Kurtz's compound, the landscape becomes increasingly unsettling. Willard and two remaining crewmen, Chef and Lance, reach Kurtz's outpost, a Khmer temple filled with Montagnard tribesmen and the remains of victims. Willard encounters a deranged photojournalist who idolizes Kurtz. Willard is captured and brought before Kurtz, who holds him captive and lectures him on his theories of war, praising the Viet Cong's ruthlessness. Kurtz throws Chef's severed head into Willard's lap as a warning. Willard eventually infiltrates Kurtz's inner sanctum and, as the Montagnards ritually sacrifice a water buffalo, Willard brutally assassinates Kurtz with a machete. Willard leaves the compound, carrying a collection of Kurtz's writings, and is revered by the Montagnards. He then returns to the PBR with Lance and sails away."
